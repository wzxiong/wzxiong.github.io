I am currently a master student at UC Davis in Math Statistic and Civil Engineering Department. Before this, I earn my Bachelor degree from Tongji University in China. I have taken many machine learning, deep learning competitions, part of those can be find here, if you want to see more, you can go to my GitHub page which is shared at the end of the document. I am correctly doing research on NLP and building ChatBox, and I hope I will work as a Data Scientist or machine learner in the future.

[**141B-Final Project： What affect California home price**]( http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/wzxiong/What-affects-home-price-in-California/blob/master/STA%2B141B%2BProject%2BHouse%2BPrice.html)

This project tends to find the relationship between public school rating and racial composition and their influences in home prices. In addition, we examine the relationship between crime occurrence and house price. In the end, we use web scraping to predict the trend of the house price.
